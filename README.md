# Hotel_GUI
### A mock Hotel GUI project using Java, Swing, and MySQL 

The main purpose of this program was for me to get comfortable using mySQL database and the JDBC.

Main screen features:
  - Add a new reservation to the database
  - Manage existing reservations
  - Manage hotel rooms
  - Edit and update guest information

Reservation details are created and stored in a mySQL database
- only rooms that have an 'open' status are available

Existing reservations can be deleted from the database

Rooms can also be disabled for maintenance or cleaning, if there is no reservation
